## Pulse Sensor
This is an already built in small sensor that allows to monitor heart-rate and biofeedback. It is compatible with Arduino, ESP32 and other boards. 

## Instructions
- Solder pins to sensor
- Cover the pins with hot silicone glue
- Cover the wires using thermofit
- Cut and make a velcro strip to attach to the sensor and cover a finger with a little pressure
- In your Arduino IDE install the "Pulse Sensor Playground" Library
- When you have already the library installed, you can find several examples to try.
We are going to start with the code in this repository.

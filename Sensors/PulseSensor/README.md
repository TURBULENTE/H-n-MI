## Pulse Sensor
This is an already built in small sensor that allows to monitor heart-rate and biofeedback. It is compatible with Arduino, ESP32 and other boards. 

## Instructions
### Preparing the sensor
- Solder pins to sensor.
- Cover the soldered pins with hot silicone glue.
- Cover the wires with heat shrink tubing (AKA thermofit).
- Cut and prepare a Velcro strip to attach the sensor to a finger with slight pressure.
- Connect + to 3V3, - to GND and the data wire to Barduino pin No. 1

### Code
- In your Arduino IDE install the "Pulse Sensor Playground" Library.
- Once the library is installed, you can find several examples to try.
We are going to start with the code in this repository called "GettingStarted-BeatLed"
